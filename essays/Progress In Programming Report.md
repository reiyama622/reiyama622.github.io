My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:
I am able to think critically about the code before I execute it. I think about ways I would go about solving the problem before I start to code.

I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:
I need to work on understanding how different languages work together. I still get confused when to use HTML, or Javascript. Sometimes we use Javascript in an HTML file and I get a little confused when to put the javascript code and when to use HTML.

I can do the WODs without looking at the screencast solutions first.
Yes. The labs often help with the WODs since they reflect the objectives we are going over that week.

The labs have helped me to learn and I am able to complete them with confidence.
Yes. The labs make it easier to understand concepts because we use examples to show what we have been covering in the class. The examples help so that I am able to modify the examlpes to be relative to what we are doing. 

I feel I am ready to work on the next stage of complexity in programming (building small web applications like Assignment 1).
Yes. I believe that I am ready to use the concepts we previously learned and build upon them. 

I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:
I would like more examples of the concepts we cover. By looking at examples I am able to understand how things work and how 

These are things that work really well for my learning in this class:
Completing the labs and going back to the screencast to understand what was happening helps. When I initally do the lab in class, I don't really understand what is going on so when I go back to the screencast I try to understand what we are doing.
