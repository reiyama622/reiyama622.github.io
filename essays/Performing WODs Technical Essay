Provide a brief introduction to the WOD along with a link to this page for further details
Invoice 1 required that we create a reciept page. This reciept showed the name of the product, the number purchased, and the price of a single product. It then instructed that you format this information into a table. At the bottom of the tabe we were supposed to calculate the total, tax, and the total plus tax. When performing this WOD I got stuck when it came to making the table for the subtotal, tax and the grand total. I wasn't sure how to put the javascript information into an HTML table. After reading it several times I realized that I could just use the id tag and innerHTML to put the javascript into the table.

To Prepare for this WOD I actually read the entire assignment before starting the exercise. Usually, I simply read the assignment as I work on the WOD. That usually slows me down because sometimes I don't know what to expect next and the order that I work doesn't really make sense to me and I often end up going back to fix things that could have been avoided. Since I actually read the assignment beforehand I think it was a lot easier for my thoughts to flow as I worked, and I think it made me work a lot faster. I could have brushed up on previous labs and WODS. I think that would have helped when I got stuck on making an HTML table with Javascript.
