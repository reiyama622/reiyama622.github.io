My name is Rei Yamamoto and I am majoring in Management Information Systems at the Shidler College of Business. I have always loved learning how things work and working with technology. Prior to starting college, I always enjoyed working with nubmers so I knew that I wanted to pursue a degree in something analytical so I decided to major in Computer Science. During my time in the College of Sciences, I realized that I didn't want to just code. That is when my sister suggested that I look into data analytics. It combines my love of math with my interest in technology which I think is the perfect combination.
