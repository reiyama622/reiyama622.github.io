My name is Rei Yamamoto and I am majoring in Management Information Systems at the Shidler College of Business. I have always loved learning how things work and working with technology. Prior to starting college, I always enjoyed working with nubmers so I knew that I wanted to pursue a degree in something analytical so I decided to major in MIS.
