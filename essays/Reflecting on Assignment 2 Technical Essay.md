Assignment 2 required that we build upon assignment 1. We had to add a user registration and a user log-in to our initial website. We used a JSON file to store the user's data and used it to check if the data the user was typing in matched what we had on file. While completing this assignment, I learned to use client and server side processing. The user had to input data and the code had to check if it is an existing user, then if the data matched what we had. This was difficult because there were many possible outcomes tht could have occured to testing and debugging took up a majority of my time. The labs definately helped for this assignment because when completing lab 14 there was an exercise where we had to build a log-in and it was very similar and needed small tweaks to fit assignemnt 2. This assignment was alightly different than assignment 1 because twe had to check for the user's data and if they were a new customer we had to store the data. I would say that about 50% of my time was spent debugging and testing my code, then 30% was spent writing new code, and the last 20% was referencing past labs and modules to figure out how to solve the problems. If I had to go back in time, I would test my code for often. Somtimes I was stuck on a single problem and came to realize that it was solved way back and that the new code I was writing was messing up what I did previously.
